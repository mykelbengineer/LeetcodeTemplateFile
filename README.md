# Leetcode Solution Tracker Sheet
## Improve your leetcode pass rate, poblem pattern recognition and solution retention

Let's be honest, for the majority of us, solving leetcode is just not what we would want to do. 
Its difficult, takes along time to get good at, doesn't translate that well to what we do at work and takes a lot of effort on top of our daily lives.
Worst of it all, you forget everything you've done very quickly if you don't go back to it

This led me to develop a simple spreadsheet that I use to help me track my progress and also help me revise questions I have solved. Since I started using this spreadsheet, I have significantly gotten better at remembering patterns and solving questions I have not seen before. A big part of remembering something is how many times you have seen it and this is exactly what this spreadsheet is based on

It comes with the 170 questions and patterns that Sean Prashad developed

## Instructions

```
Each sheet of this spreadsheet contains a leetcode pattern. 
While these questions aren't an exhaustive list of all leetcode questions, 
if you are able to  go through these questions with relative ease, most leetode questions should come relatively 
easy for you.
Some questions are repeated between multiple patterns. If you solve Jump Game using dynamic programming because its more intuitive that way, try solving it using a greedy approach. This way you develop a skill of using multiple approaches for the same question
